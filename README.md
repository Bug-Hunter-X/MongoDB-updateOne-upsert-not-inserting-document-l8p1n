# MongoDB updateOne upsert Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered when using the `updateOne` method with the `upsert` option in MongoDB. The issue involves the unexpected behavior of `upsert` where it fails to insert a new document when no matching document is found.

## Problem Description

The provided code snippet attempts to update a document in the 'users' collection. If a document matching the provided query doesn't exist, the `upsert: true` option should create a new document. However, in certain cases (possibly related to specific configurations or data types), this insertion doesn't occur, resulting in an update operation on a non-existent document (which essentially does nothing).

## Solution

To resolve this, ensure data types in query match data types in the collection. Also, explicitly check for the existence of a document using `findOne` before performing the update operation.
